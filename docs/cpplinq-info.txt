== DESCRIPTION ==
cpplinq is an open-source native template library that provides a set of LINQ-like operators for querying collections (arrays and STL containers) in C++11.

The library contains a single header file and the API consists on a set of template classes and functions and is compatible with all major compilers.

cpplinq - LINQ Query Operators for C++ Sequences
  http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/488177/cpplinq-LINQ-Query-Operators-for-Cplusplus-Sequenc

== HOW TO USE ==
1. Download the latest version of the source code from here (it's small): http://cpplinq.codeplex.com/downloads/get/616650
2. Add the header file to your C++ project
3. Include the header in the source files were you want to use the query operators (which are defined in the cpplinq namespace)
4. In VC++, you have to define NOMINMAX in order to avoid including the min/max macros. If you use NuGet, this is automatically defined.

== EXAMPLES ==
The following example shows how to compute the sum of the even numbers from an array.

    #include "cpplinq.hpp"

    void computes_a_sum ()
    {
        using namespace cpplinq;
        int ints[] = {3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,4};

        auto result =    from_array (ints)
                      >> where ([](int i) {return i%2 ==0;})  // Keep only even numbers
                      >> sum ()                               // Sum remaining numbers
                      ;
    }

The next sample shows how to identify the distinct elements of a sequence.

    int ints[] = {3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,4};
    auto result =    from_array(ints)
                  >> distinct()   // identify distinct elements
                  >> to_vector()  // fold the result to a vector
                  ;

Given the customer and customer_address types shown bellow and the arrays with customers and addresses in this listing

    struct customer
    {
        std::size_t     id          ;
        std::string     first_name  ;
        std::string     last_name   ;
    };

    struct customer_address
    {
        std::size_t     id          ;
        std::size_t     customer_id ;
        std::string     country     ;
    };

    customer customers[] =
    {
        customer (1 , "Bill"    , "Gates"   ),
        customer (2 , "Steve"   , "Jobs"    ),
        customer (3 , "Richard" , "Stallman"),
        customer (4 , "Linus"   , "Torvalds"),
    };

    customer_address customer_addresses[] =
    {
        customer_address (1, 1, "USA"       ),
        customer_address (2, 4, "Finland"   ),
        customer_address (3, 4, "USA"       ),
    };

we can join them with the following piece of code:

    auto result =
           from_array(customers)
        >> join (
                from_array(customer_addresses),
                [](customer const & c) {return c.id;},
                [](customer_address const & ca) {return ca.customer_id;},
                [](customer const & c, customer_address const & ca) {return std::make_pair (c, ca);},
           )
        >> to_vector();
